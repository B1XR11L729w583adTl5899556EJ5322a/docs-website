If you are using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to build a [Shared Services Platform (SSP)](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/ssp-amazon-eks/), you can deploy the New Relic Kubernetes observability solution using our [Add-on](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/newrelic-ssp-addon). Doing so helps you:

Optimize performance with cluster-wide observability, dashboarding, and alerting.
Accelerate productivity by automating the deployment of observability tooling.
Standardize on observability best practices in all deployments.
